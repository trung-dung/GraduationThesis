Environmental monitoring has an important role in ensuring quality of life and limiting the risk of harm to the environment and living organisms.\\
This project will research and design prototyping devices continuously to monitor the water environment for the aquaculture sector.\\
The mission of the project includes:\\
CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM
\begin{itemize}
\item   Evaluating the importance of the system.
\item   Determining the purpose of research and research methods. 
\end{itemize}
CHAPTER 2: UNDERSTANDING THEORY.
Learn the issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item   32-bit MCU Microcontroller ARM Cortex-M3 core of the company STMicroelectronics.
\item 	Using the programming tools to development on 32-bit microcontroller ARM Cortex - M3. (STM32CubeMX configuration software, software loading: ST-Link, J-Link... Software IDE, compilers: C Keil, IAR, Coocox,...)
\item	GSM Network.
\item	Module SIM Ublox Leon G-100 (Application-based on GSM/GPRS)
\end{itemize}	
CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN
\begin{itemize}
